            "Hey sean this weekend did you notice that the march for our lives returned i did notice yes did you hear much about it being you know a protest that happened all across this country of ours know that i didn't know i guess the past few weeks and maybe the past month has had me wondering. The gun control movement in this country. Is a failure i mean it doesn't seem like a success. So on the show today i thought we'd ask someone who's been studying this movement for decades and a guy who's been a part of it for decades to see how they feel about it and it's part of something we're going to try and do this week on the show is just understand this issue of guns in america understand it through the protest movement understand it constitutionally understand it politically because there might actually be some action in the coming weeks very cool i am looking forward to learning something. What if we could see cyber threats in real life they would be everywhere always watching looking to gain access to our networks clouds and applications yesterday's technology can no longer stop them but they can be stopped with consistent cybersecurity that protects work everywhere. Zero trust with zero exceptions by palo alto networks we've got next. This episode is brought to you by the london dungeon london home to palaces pigeons. I'm the london dungeon descend beneath the capital of streets to see here feel and smell the characters who lived through its chilling past what horrors will you encounter their two harrowing to mention here so you'll have to find out for yourself the london dungeon visit the dungeons for tickets. It's like explained i'm sean ramos from and as i told noel at the top of the show i've been wondering if the gun control movement in the united states is. A failed effort. Or maybe i've been wondering if it just could be more pairs. If the march for our lives had been. Happening every year every month every week instead of once and then again four years later could there have been more tangible change. On today explained we're going to ask a couple of people who've been studying and participating in this movement for decades starting with kristen gas when we told people we wanted to assess the gun control movement everyone told us to speak to kristen gas i am a professor of public policy and political science at the sanford school of public policy at duke university kristen's been watching the gun control movement for decades. Out of columbine i wrote a phd dissertation which became a book. What about the challenges that gun violence prevention advocates have in organizing a mass movement and the subtitle of that book was the missing movement for gun control in america and that book came out in 2006 and she's got a surprising answer to the question of whether the gun control movement has just sort of failed i can say without any doubt that the movement is no longer missing and it's better organized better funded. And you know i would say arguably more successful. In history. So why do things feel so hopeless to so many americans. She had an answer for that too. We all focus on congress and you know the terrible shootings happen. Use the congress doesn't even consider gun violence prevention. Legislation they did after sandy hook they didn't pass the key bill which would have created some sort of universal background check system that failed to pass so everybody said oh this horrible thing happened to sandy hook and nothing changed well that's just false i mean many state laws changed. Many organizations were founded a lot of money came in. But things things are happening. I think the parkland mass shooting was. A very important pivot point but it joined a number of other similar high-profile events throughout history that each. Has sort of brought in a new group or a new constituency to advocate for stricter gun laws columbine was an important event for bringing in mothers and you know those organizations that mobilize around the time of columbine stayed active kind of under the media radar for a number of years and working you know chiefly at the state level five in 2007 was a really important point the parents of those students who were shot and the family members of the instructors and work to get a bill through congress yes our congress in a republican administration to strengthen the reporting of records to our national background checks system and it is a day of sadness strengthen their gun laws insignificant ways a number of other states strengthen their laws around mental health and firearms access but more important i think sandy hook really marked the beginning of kind of an expansion in the gun violence prevention movement because i think you get to a point where enough is enough i don't think that any student should ever have to go through that a lot of money to gun violence prevention movement and it's you know it ebbs and flows but there's more money now than there was at any other time and more importantly groups that are organized around gun control and groups that just have an interest in it where it's one of many things they care about god organized around a common policy agenda so you know then parkland comes along and almost half the state strengthen their gun laws in the immediate aftermath and half of these states included something like 14 that had republican governors today we have an obligation brought in the lgbtq community so each of these mass shootings which are you know terrifying and tragic our serving as kind of galvanizing points for different constituencies of interest to sort of join in this. You gave us this sort of 20 years old history dating back to columbine but surely that isn't when. The gun control movement in the united states begins where does that trace back to at least some sort of its modern form. Yeah there was some kind of fleeting organizational efforts. In 1968 after the assassinations of dr king and bobby kennedy but the modern gun violence prevention movement or gun control movement is what is known at the time really started coming together in the mid-70s so in that time period you had sort of an uptick in crime the spread of handguns particularly cheap handguns. How was occurring at that time and two national gun control groups that are still around were founded in 1974 so one is what we now call brady we are all united against gun violence and the other is what we now call the coalition to stop gun violence and the gun control. Guns and bad guys with guns can flow easily across state lines so if you really want to regulate. Effectiveness but meanwhile the gun rights. Find epitomized by the nra was organized in a federated way so there's a national nra they've got state affiliates and you know pistol and gun clubs in every state i believe there are local. Spaces where gun owners can congregate in gun stores or gun shows or gun ranges. Where they can practice their hobby but also share political information recruit each other into activism so. Yeah the nra is organized the way that our government is organized and so they're ready to plug in at any level to advocate for gun deregulation or to try to block. Proposed gun control laws and the gun violence prevention movement is always been much more kind of top down. At least on the professional side this is really important thing to say here which is you know in in communities of color and in cities where gun violence can have. There have always been community-based organizations organic led by. Trying to stop violence but they don't tend to be connected to one another connected to professional organizations they don't have any money and they often are doing kind of community-based. Interventions as opposed to start a policy advocacy so the gun control movement of the gun violence prevention movement has a lot of different pieces to it. Hasn't been that coordinated historically but i think that coordination and that kind of bridge building across different. Parts of the movement has really. Improved in recent years. But we're still in this place where we're still having mass shootings like buffalo like vivaldi and as of 20/20 guns are the leading cause of death for american kids and shootings are up across the country these. Piecemeal accomplishments along the way. Haven't accomplished enough it would seem. Maybe a little bit of a copy out to what you said so one is. You can use the word piecemeal or incremental and that sounds in like ineffective. One of the issues with gun laws. Is that. So we have these laws on the books that the federal and state level that say you know this person can't buy a gun or you know this person can't possess a gun. The enforcement mechanisms that are in place so for example if you. Come under a permanent restraining order. Because you've committed domestic violence you're not supposed to own a gun well what if you already have a gun. What is the state say about whether you have to relinquish that gun is a judge ordering you to really push the gun to you know do the states know that you have that gun. Are the police going to go to your house and get it. Enforcement. Piecemeal incremental changes are aimed at doing that. Changes to existing laws they can't they can't actually matter a lot. And i think there's been a lot more attention to enforcement and implementation of laws in in recent years i mean much less i mean still a lot of attention to getting new laws on the books. You know the other thing i would say you're in a you're right obviously laws on the books did not. Stop buffalo or vivaldi or the community based gun violence that we're going to see were in washington dc tonight you know where i am but we don't know the counterfactual either so if none of these. Quote unquote incremental or piecemeal laws have been passed. Would it have been even worse you know we don't know that. So you always have to think about what's the alternative or what's the counterfactual that you can't see how many baldies might have happened if. I'm not going to ask you to prove another counterfactual but. To sort of bring this back to my initial question. The march for our lives was this incredibly powerful. Protest. The school walkouts that happened were incredibly disruptive around the same time. I can't help it feel that. If there was that kind of sustained attention and and and and and and protest on this issue. It could accomplish. Much more and as someone who studies this i wonder if you feel the same way. Yeah i mean of course i think if if young people walked out of. School for three straight years or four straight years. Politicians would notice. I think there is a lot of. Deja vu groundhog day. The gun issue so. You know you can look at what happened after columbine and what happened after sandy hook. Tons of parallels there. But i think again you know we aren't incremental country and you know that that's very frustrating when you're talking about life and death situations like with gun violence or climate change for that matter politicians will pay attention when unexpected constituencies get involved they like predictability they like to know kind of how the distribution of votes is going to be they like to know who's going to. Get agitated and who's who's going to stay quiet when you start shaking that up that's when they pay attention and you know we recently opened up our phone lines and. So many people just called in. How many more of these have to happen what can we actually do. And it didn't sound like a political thing it was just i want to know what i can do so i can live in a country where this just doesn't happen anymore. As someone who's been. Studying what people have done for 25 years. What would you say to those people. I would say what are your interests what particular part of this gun violence problem that we have are you most interested in some people are really touched by suicide some people are touched by community violence some people are touched by school shootings etc and i figure out what what is it that stirs your passion and i would join an organization i mean the capacity is there the expertise is there. There are organizations that are ready to. Take you in and use your skills i think one example of this and his family members and survivors so. When i was doing my first book i remember asking a leading national gun control person why is it that you know so many people are touched by gun violence but like there isn't a movement of victims or survivors or family members i don't where are they in this and you know they were always there but they weren't there like with a big megaphone and a big platform and and i remember he said you know where we always feel really nervous about approaching people who are have just experienced this life-changing trauma. And i think that that reticence has gone away. Which is the largest now of the national gun violence prevention groups has a whole sort of division devoted to supporting survivors and family members. Giving them a platform giving them training giving them money to go and speak to organizations so. You know i think it's just a matter of what are your you know what are your interests and what are your skills these organizations will bring you in that's that's a big difference from the early era where it was much more kind of elite staff led organizations with not a lot of room for. Volunteer mobilization everyday citizen mobilization that's different now that was professor kristen goss with duke university in a minute we'll hear from a lawyer who was touched by suicide and then became an activist it's today explained. Support for the chevrolet comes from masterclass you've heard of masterclass if you've ever used youtube cuz there's all those ads for various master classes what's the master class you've always wanted maybe they'll do it tonight they want me to talk about a master class at all i wanted but i've definitely thought of this before but i can't think. Of what it is now here's one i don't know i can use a master class on how to do a drop shot in tennis that's like a shot that you hit really sort of specifically so that the ball just like floats right over the net and then just drops immediately down and dies i have no idea how to do that well and people have tried to teach me and it's not working oh here's another one i've always wanted to whistle really really loud but without using my fingers and there's actually a lot of youtube videos about this but none of them have ever helped me do it actually i just get really sort of like faint when i try and i almost pass out so then i usually have to stop anyway you can get unlimited access to every masterclass ever and as a takes place where you can get 15% off an annual membership go to masterclass.com explained now that is master class.

Today explained you've heard from kristen goss who studies activism around gun control but we thought we'd pose the same question. To an actual activist one who's been at it since 1989 i'm josh horowitz the co-director of the center for gunbound solutions at the bloomberg school of public health i asked josh how he's kept at it for 33 or so years when it seems like things have just gotten worse the jewish calendar says to us when you say one life you save the world. My goal is to substantially meaningfully reduce gun violence. And that's what i do and that's why i focus on this and so while i acknowledge the inevitability of some of these i also look to states where we've really reduced the gun death we've really save lives we've saved hundreds if not thousands of lives a year and that's why i keep doing this. What happened 30 years ago that got you into this world. I graduated law school went to a firm and a colleague of mine at the firm who i helped get a job. I was just one of those things we were slow of that fall and she was let go not because of any problem with her i was just no work was slow and unfortunately she went home and and. Took her life with a firearm. Die by suicide. And it was one of those things that just really struck me as a really painful experience instruct me like how is this happening how could someone have access to a gun. And in a really quick moment take her own life and so i you know thought about what i wanted to do with my life i knew that i didn't want to stay in private practice. And i ended up you know fucking out there and found this job. And you know i never went back it's been a rewarding sometimes frustrating experience but i never forget why why i started with this. Do you think. This country could get to the place where. The movement. Gun violence prevention. Feels as powerful as the movement. For second amendment rights or whatever you want to call it. Absolutely the answer is a good example because their power is certainly on the way but people who adhere to that it's like faith it's like religion it is part of their lives it's a big part of their sort of social construct right after sandy hook unfortunately there was some votes in the senate that were lost right we even though we got 55 votes for background checks. But what i saw was a movement developed over the last 10 years so the time of the sandy hook shooting i was one of the very few lobbyists on the hill i mean you can count them in one hand before that and since then we have become a movement of millions and millions of people with all sorts of government relations activities all sorts of grassroots activities from my perspective thinking back on what it look like in the bush administration for instance after the virginia tech shooting. There is no gun violence prevention infrastructure there's a couple of groups there was the group i work for there's a brady campaign but it was really small potatoes at the sun. Now it's completely different. So we've seen an incredible growth in the movement since 2012 i think that's going to continue this is another moment we're seeing a lot of growth so yeah i do think we're going to be as proud if we're not as powerful the nra we're going to be and certainly some states many states we are so this is a battle this is a battle. You sound so. Committed. In spite of the fact that you know in terms of how things look now. At least in terms of mass shootings. They look dramatically worse than when you got into this work right. So not really. I started the year after you know 30 children were shot at a playground in stockton california with an assault weapon with an ak-47. We were able to create a consultants band for 10 years. Assault weapons banned by this proposal are deadly dangerous weapons. They were designed for one purpose only to kill people and as long as violent criminals have easy access to them. Play will continue to be used to kill people we as a nation are determined to turn that around. It was very unfortunate there was a sunset in that but i've been dealing with massachusetts my entire. You know life in this field. And the fact that the weaponry clearly increases the death count and we're not we're not able to do anything about that in some states other states we are the machines have been around but the pace and the ability to keep selling high-capacity magazines in assault weapons that is a just absolute moral failure of our country. It doesn't mean that i can walk away or turn my back from this it means that i got to keep going and try to make more changes. That was josh horowitz he's the co-director of the center for gun violence solutions at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health in baltimore maryland are show today was produced by jillian weinberger fact checked by laura bullard engineered by paul mounsey and edited by me on tomorrow show we're going to get into the constitutionality of guns in america that's the hell are case at the supreme court back in 2008 i'm sean ramos from this is today explained. \n"

            "Hey sean this weekend did you notice that the march for our lives returned i did notice yes did you hear much about it being you know a protest that happened all across this country of ours know that i didn't know i guess the past few weeks and maybe the past month has had me wondering. The gun control movement in this country. Is a failure i mean it doesn't seem like a success. So on the show today i thought we'd ask someone who's been studying this movement for decades and a guy who's been a part of it for decades to see how they feel about it and it's part of something we're going to try and do this week on the show is just understand this issue of guns in america understand it through the protest movement understand it constitutionally understand it politically because there might actually be some action in the coming weeks very cool i am looking forward to learning something. What if we could see cyber threats in real life they would be everywhere always watching looking to gain access to our networks clouds and applications yesterday's technology can no longer stop them but they can be stopped with consistent cybersecurity that protects work everywhere. Zero trust with zero exceptions by palo alto networks we've got next. This episode is brought to you by the london dungeon london home to palaces pigeons. I'm the london dungeon descend beneath the capital of streets to see here feel and smell the characters who lived through its chilling past what horrors will you encounter their two harrowing to mention here so you'll have to find out for yourself the london dungeon visit the dungeons for tickets. It's like explained i'm sean ramos from and as i told noel at the top of the show i've been wondering if the gun control movement in the united states is. A failed effort. Or maybe i've been wondering if it just could be more pairs. If the march for our lives had been. Happening every year every month every week instead of once and then again four years later could there have been more tangible change. On today explained we're going to ask a couple of people who've been studying and participating in this movement for decades starting with kristen gas when we told people we wanted to assess the gun control movement everyone told us to speak to kristen gas i am a professor of public policy and political science at the sanford school of public policy at duke university kristen's been watching the gun control movement for decades. Out of columbine i wrote a phd dissertation which became a book. What about the challenges that gun violence prevention advocates have in organizing a mass movement and the subtitle of that book was the missing movement for gun control in america and that book came out in 2006 and she's got a surprising answer to the question of whether the gun control movement has just sort of failed i can say without any doubt that the movement is no longer missing and it's better organized better funded. And you know i would say arguably more successful. In history. So why do things feel so hopeless to so many americans. She had an answer for that too. We all focus on congress and you know the terrible shootings happen. Use the congress doesn't even consider gun violence prevention. Legislation they did after sandy hook they didn't pass the key bill which would have created some sort of universal background check system that failed to pass so everybody said oh this horrible thing happened to sandy hook and nothing changed well that's just false i mean many state laws changed. Many organizations were founded a lot of money came in. But things things are happening. I think the parkland mass shooting was. A very important pivot point but it joined a number of other similar high-profile events throughout history that each. Has sort of brought in a new group or a new constituency to advocate for stricter gun laws columbine was an important event for bringing in mothers and you know those organizations that mobilize around the time of columbine stayed active kind of under the media radar for a number of years and working you know chiefly at the state level five in 2007 was a really important point the parents of those students who were shot and the family members of the instructors and work to get a bill through congress yes our congress in a republican administration to strengthen the reporting of records to our national background checks system and it is a day of sadness strengthen their gun laws insignificant ways a number of other states strengthen their laws around mental health and firearms access but more important i think sandy hook really marked the beginning of kind of an expansion in the gun violence prevention movement because i think you get to a point where enough is enough i don't think that any student should ever have to go through that a lot of money to gun violence prevention movement and it's you know it ebbs and flows but there's more money now than there was at any other time and more importantly groups that are organized around gun control and groups that just have an interest in it where it's one of many things they care about god organized around a common policy agenda so you know then parkland comes along and almost half the state strengthen their gun laws in the immediate aftermath and half of these states included something like 14 that had republican governors today we have an obligation brought in the lgbtq community so each of these mass shootings which are you know terrifying and tragic our serving as kind of galvanizing points for different constituencies of interest to sort of join in this. You gave us this sort of 20 years old history dating back to columbine but surely that isn't when. The gun control movement in the united states begins where does that trace back to at least some sort of its modern form. Yeah there was some kind of fleeting organizational efforts. In 1968 after the assassinations of dr king and bobby kennedy but the modern gun violence prevention movement or gun control movement is what is known at the time really started coming together in the mid-70s so in that time period you had sort of an uptick in crime the spread of handguns particularly cheap handguns. How was occurring at that time and two national gun control groups that are still around were founded in 1974 so one is what we now call brady we are all united against gun violence and the other is what we now call the coalition to stop gun violence and the gun control. Guns and bad guys with guns can flow easily across state lines so if you really want to regulate. Effectiveness but meanwhile the gun rights. Find epitomized by the nra was organized in a federated way so there's a national nra they've got state affiliates and you know pistol and gun clubs in every state i believe there are local. Spaces where gun owners can congregate in gun stores or gun shows or gun ranges. Where they can practice their hobby but also share political information recruit each other into activism so. Yeah the nra is organized the way that our government is organized and so they're ready to plug in at any level to advocate for gun deregulation or to try to block. Proposed gun control laws and the gun violence prevention movement is always been much more kind of top down. At least on the professional side this is really important thing to say here which is you know in in communities of color and in cities where gun violence can have. There have always been community-based organizations organic led by. Trying to stop violence but they don't tend to be connected to one another connected to professional organizations they don't have any money and they often are doing kind of community-based. Interventions as opposed to start a policy advocacy so the gun control movement of the gun violence prevention movement has a lot of different pieces to it. Hasn't been that coordinated historically but i think that coordination and that kind of bridge building across different. Parts of the movement has really. Improved in recent years. But we're still in this place where we're still having mass shootings like buffalo like vivaldi and as of 20/20 guns are the leading cause of death for american kids and shootings are up across the country these. Piecemeal accomplishments along the way. Haven't accomplished enough it would seem. Maybe a little bit of a copy out to what you said so one is. You can use the word piecemeal or incremental and that sounds in like ineffective. One of the issues with gun laws. Is that. So we have these laws on the books that the federal and state level that say you know this person can't buy a gun or you know this person can't possess a gun. The enforcement mechanisms that are in place so for example if you. Come under a permanent restraining order. Because you've committed domestic violence you're not supposed to own a gun well what if you already have a gun. What is the state say about whether you have to relinquish that gun is a judge ordering you to really push the gun to you know do the states know that you have that gun. Are the police going to go to your house and get it. Enforcement. Piecemeal incremental changes are aimed at doing that. Changes to existing laws they can't they can't actually matter a lot. And i think there's been a lot more attention to enforcement and implementation of laws in in recent years i mean much less i mean still a lot of attention to getting new laws on the books. You know the other thing i would say you're in a you're right obviously laws on the books did not. Stop buffalo or vivaldi or the community based gun violence that we're going to see were in washington dc tonight you know where i am but we don't know the counterfactual either so if none of these. Quote unquote incremental or piecemeal laws have been passed. Would it have been even worse you know we don't know that. So you always have to think about what's the alternative or what's the counterfactual that you can't see how many baldies might have happened if. I'm not going to ask you to prove another counterfactual but. To sort of bring this back to my initial question. The march for our lives was this incredibly powerful. Protest. The school walkouts that happened were incredibly disruptive around the same time. I can't help it feel that. If there was that kind of sustained attention and and and and and and protest on this issue. It could accomplish. Much more and as someone who studies this i wonder if you feel the same way. Yeah i mean of course i think if if young people walked out of. School for three straight years or four straight years. Politicians would notice. I think there is a lot of. Deja vu groundhog day. The gun issue so. You know you can look at what happened after columbine and what happened after sandy hook. Tons of parallels there. But i think again you know we aren't incremental country and you know that that's very frustrating when you're talking about life and death situations like with gun violence or climate change for that matter politicians will pay attention when unexpected constituencies get involved they like predictability they like to know kind of how the distribution of votes is going to be they like to know who's going to. Get agitated and who's who's going to stay quiet when you start shaking that up that's when they pay attention and you know we recently opened up our phone lines and. So many people just called in. How many more of these have to happen what can we actually do. And it didn't sound like a political thing it was just i want to know what i can do so i can live in a country where this just doesn't happen anymore. As someone who's been. Studying what people have done for 25 years. What would you say to those people. I would say what are your interests what particular part of this gun violence problem that we have are you most interested in some people are really touched by suicide some people are touched by community violence some people are touched by school shootings etc and i figure out what what is it that stirs your passion and i would join an organization i mean the capacity is there the expertise is there. There are organizations that are ready to. Take you in and use your skills i think one example of this and his family members and survivors so. When i was doing my first book i remember asking a leading national gun control person why is it that you know so many people are touched by gun violence but like there isn't a movement of victims or survivors or family members i don't where are they in this and you know they were always there but they weren't there like with a big megaphone and a big platform and and i remember he said you know where we always feel really nervous about approaching people who are have just experienced this life-changing trauma. And i think that that reticence has gone away. Which is the largest now of the national gun violence prevention groups has a whole sort of division devoted to supporting survivors and family members. Giving them a platform giving them training giving them money to go and speak to organizations so. You know i think it's just a matter of what are your you know what are your interests and what are your skills these organizations will bring you in that's that's a big difference from the early era where it was much more kind of elite staff led organizations with not a lot of room for. Volunteer mobilization everyday citizen mobilization that's different now that was professor kristen goss with duke university in a minute we'll hear from a lawyer who was touched by suicide and then became an activist it's today explained. Support for the chevrolet comes from masterclass you've heard of masterclass if you've ever used youtube cuz there's all those ads for various master classes what's the master class you've always wanted maybe they'll do it tonight they want me to talk about a master class at all i wanted but i've definitely thought of this before but i can't think. Of what it is now here's one i don't know i can use a master class on how to do a drop shot in tennis that's like a shot that you hit really sort of specifically so that the ball just like floats right over the net and then just drops immediately down and dies i have no idea how to do that well and people have tried to teach me and it's not working oh here's another one i've always wanted to whistle really really loud but without using my fingers and there's actually a lot of youtube videos about this but none of them have ever helped me do it actually i just get really sort of like faint when i try and i almost pass out so then i usually have to stop anyway you can get unlimited access to every masterclass ever and as a takes place where you can get 15% off an annual membership go to masterclass.com explained now that is master class.

Today explained you've heard from kristen goss who studies activism around gun control but we thought we'd pose the same question. To an actual activist one who's been at it since 1989 i'm josh horowitz the co-director of the center for gunbound solutions at the bloomberg school of public health i asked josh how he's kept at it for 33 or so years when it seems like things have just gotten worse the jewish calendar says to us when you say one life you save the world. My goal is to substantially meaningfully reduce gun violence. And that's what i do and that's why i focus on this and so while i acknowledge the inevitability of some of these i also look to states where we've really reduced the gun death we've really save lives we've saved hundreds if not thousands of lives a year and that's why i keep doing this. What happened 30 years ago that got you into this world. I graduated law school went to a firm and a colleague of mine at the firm who i helped get a job. I was just one of those things we were slow of that fall and she was let go not because of any problem with her i was just no work was slow and unfortunately she went home and and. Took her life with a firearm. Die by suicide. And it was one of those things that just really struck me as a really painful experience instruct me like how is this happening how could someone have access to a gun. And in a really quick moment take her own life and so i you know thought about what i wanted to do with my life i knew that i didn't want to stay in private practice. And i ended up you know fucking out there and found this job. And you know i never went back it's been a rewarding sometimes frustrating experience but i never forget why why i started with this. Do you think. This country could get to the place where. The movement. Gun violence prevention. Feels as powerful as the movement. For second amendment rights or whatever you want to call it. Absolutely the answer is a good example because their power is certainly on the way but people who adhere to that it's like faith it's like religion it is part of their lives it's a big part of their sort of social construct right after sandy hook unfortunately there was some votes in the senate that were lost right we even though we got 55 votes for background checks. But what i saw was a movement developed over the last 10 years so the time of the sandy hook shooting i was one of the very few lobbyists on the hill i mean you can count them in one hand before that and since then we have become a movement of millions and millions of people with all sorts of government relations activities all sorts of grassroots activities from my perspective thinking back on what it look like in the bush administration for instance after the virginia tech shooting. There is no gun violence prevention infrastructure there's a couple of groups there was the group i work for there's a brady campaign but it was really small potatoes at the sun. Now it's completely different. So we've seen an incredible growth in the movement since 2012 i think that's going to continue this is another moment we're seeing a lot of growth so yeah i do think we're going to be as proud if we're not as powerful the nra we're going to be and certainly some states many states we are so this is a battle this is a battle. You sound so. Committed. In spite of the fact that you know in terms of how things look now. At least in terms of mass shootings. They look dramatically worse than when you got into this work right. So not really. I started the year after you know 30 children were shot at a playground in stockton california with an assault weapon with an ak-47. We were able to create a consultants band for 10 years. Assault weapons banned by this proposal are deadly dangerous weapons. They were designed for one purpose only to kill people and as long as violent criminals have easy access to them. Play will continue to be used to kill people we as a nation are determined to turn that around. It was very unfortunate there was a sunset in that but i've been dealing with massachusetts my entire. You know life in this field. And the fact that the weaponry clearly increases the death count and we're not we're not able to do anything about that in some states other states we are the machines have been around but the pace and the ability to keep selling high-capacity magazines in assault weapons that is a just absolute moral failure of our country. It doesn't mean that i can walk away or turn my back from this it means that i got to keep going and try to make more changes. That was josh horowitz he's the co-director of the center for gun violence solutions at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health in baltimore maryland are show today was produced by jillian weinberger fact checked by laura bullard engineered by paul mounsey and edited by me on tomorrow show we're going to get into the constitutionality of guns in america that's the hell are case at the supreme court back in 2008 i'm sean ramos from this is today explained. \n",
